# fantastic-succotash

A code example to access a URL, consume some JSON returned from the endpoint, and display it. The display can be switched to display in a list or a grid from the Action Bar. 
Rotation is supported and the app caches the data during this transition. 
Clicking on an item opens a second page where the image takes up most of the screen and more detail is shown. 

This second screen is portrait only. A slider is available to make the Image transition from a square to a circle.

This code uses libraries like I would use in a production enviroment.

* ButterKnife
* Retrofit
* RxJava
* RxAndroid
* Picasso
